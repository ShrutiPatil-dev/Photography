     <p>Photography is not just about capturing moments but it's about treasuring those moments
        and it's our vision to capture beautiful moments Advertising photography: photographs made 
        to illustrate and usually sell a service or product. These images, such as packshots, 
        are generally done with an advertising agency, design firm or with an in-house corporate design team.Still life
        photography usually depicts inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which
        may be either natural or man-made. Still life is a broader category 
        for food and some natural photography and can be used for advertising purposes.
        Food photography can be used for editorial, packaging or advertising use. Food photography
         is similar to still life photography but requires some special skills.Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.
